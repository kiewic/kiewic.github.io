On my last year of college, I had took a Cryptography class, and about the same time, I was doing "social service" and as part of my social service, I was requested to participate in a science fair in my old high school.

I was very interested in cryptography, and decided to prepare a demo about it for the science fair. However, I finished my demo around 4 pm and arrived my high school about 5 pm. Too late. My supervisor at social service did not wanted to look anymore at my demo.

Such a waste of time. Bad organization from me.

But I really liked my demo, and it has been stored in pen drive all these years, until today, that I have dicided to go public and show you all what this demo was about.
