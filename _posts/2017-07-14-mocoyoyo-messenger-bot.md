[Mocoyoyo][mocoyoyobot] is a bot that helps you count the days until any date or event important for you. For example your birthday, your next trip to Europe, your wedding or the Chinese New Year.

It is very easy to use, simply answer four questions: year, month, day and name of the event, and select the frequency you wish to receive the reminders.
