<p>Today I defined hundreds of breakpoints, including breakpoints in functions A, B and C.</p>
<p>When I break into function A, I want to go up (run until the current function returns) without breaking into other breakpoint.</p>
<pre>MyApp!A &lt;--- First break.<br />MyApp!main &lt;--- I want to go back to main without breaking anywhere else.</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, function A calls B and B calls C. So I have to break into B:</p>
<pre>MyApp!B &lt;--- Second break.<br />MyApp!A<br />MyApp!main</pre>
<p>And then into C:</p>
<pre>MyApp!C &lt;--- Third break.<br />MyApp!B<br />MyApp!A<br />MyApp!main</pre>
<p>Before coming back to main.</p>
<p>And easy solution to this problem is to disable all breakpoints, go up, and re-enable all breakpoints, i.e.:</p>
<pre>bd *; gu; be *;</pre>
<p>You don't have to remove B and C breakpoints and define them again after going up.</p>
<p> </p>
