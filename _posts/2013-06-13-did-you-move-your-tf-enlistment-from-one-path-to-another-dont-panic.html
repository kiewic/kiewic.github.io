<p>So, you decided to move your enlistment folder from location in your computer and now you are seeing the following error:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unable to determine the workspace. You may be able to correct this by running 'tf workspaces /collection:TeamProjectCollectionUrl'.</p>
<p>Follow the next 5 steps to fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a "<strong>Developer Command Prompt for VS2012</strong>".</li>
<li>Type "<strong>tf workspaces</strong>".</li>
<li>Copy the name of your workspace.</li>
<li>Type "<strong>tf workspace</strong> <strong>&lt;your workspace name here&gt;</strong>"</li>
<li>Update the "<strong>Local Folder</strong>" with the new location of your enlistment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wallah! Now it is fixed!</p>
