<p>It happened to me that I had a TFS enlistment in a virtual hard drive, and when I attached it to a different virtual machine, well, the host name and the drive letter were different. <strong>"tf workspaces"</strong> was not enough this time. But finally, I was able to found the information of my work space doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Query all work spaces from the server: <strong>tf workspaces /owner:* /collection:http://SourceControlServer:8080/TeamProjectCollection</strong></li>
<li>Find your old work space in the results, and take note of the name and the old computer name.</li>
<li>Update the computer name: <strong>tf workspaces /updateComputerName:YourOldComputerName /collection:http://SourceControlServer:8080/TeamProjectCollection</strong></li>
<li>Fix the path (Local Folder): <strong>tf workspace YourWorkspaceName /collection:http://SourceControlServer:8080/TeamProjectCollection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Don't forget to replace YourWorkspaceName, YourOldComputerName, SourceControlServer and TeamProjectCollection with your own information.</p>
<p>Voilà! Now it is fixed.</p>
