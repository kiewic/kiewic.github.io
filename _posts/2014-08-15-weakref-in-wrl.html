<p>So, you have two objects that are related. A mother gorilla and a baby  gorilla. You want the mother gorilla can reference the baby gorilla, and vice versa, so you add a reference to the baby from the mother and another reference to the mother from the baby.</p>
<pre>class MotherGorilla : public RuntimeClass&lt;FtmBase&gt;
{
private:
    ComPtr&lt;BabyGorilla&gt; baby;
};

class BabyGorilla : public RuntimeClass&lt;FtmBase&gt;
{
private:
    ComPtr&lt;MotherGorilla&gt; mother;
};</pre>
<p>Guess what? In COM, where the objects are freed until the reference counter hits zero, the mom's counter will never be zero because the baby has a reference to the mom, and the baby's counter will never be zero because the mom holds a reference to the baby. Possible memory leak.</p>
<p>Fix? Make one of the references a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/br244853.aspx">weak reference</a>.</p>
<pre>class MotherGorilla : public RuntimeClass&lt;FtmBase&gt;
{
private:
    WeakRef baby;
};

// BabyGorilla class requires a UUID, otherwise WeakRef::CopyTo()
// fails with "error C2787: 'BabyGorilla' : no GUID has been
// associated with this object"
[uuid("7c8ab438-a275-467f-8bdd-7e556e0016f4")]
class BabyGorilla : public RuntimeClass&lt;FtmBase&gt;
{
private:
    ComPtr&lt;MotherGorilla&gt; mother;
};
</pre>
<p>And each time the mother wants to interact with the baby, she will need to get a hard reference to the baby by calling <strong>WeakRef::As</strong> or <strong>WeakRef::CopyTo</strong>.</p>
